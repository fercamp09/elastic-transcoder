# Vagrant vm

1. Install Vagrant. https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/

  Username: vagrant<br>
  Password: vagrant

2. Run the virtual machine. To run the virtual machine execute this line in bash:
  ```bash
  $ vagrant up
  ```

3. Install VM VirtualBox. https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

4. Change Network configurations inside Virtualbox for the created virtual machine. Set Bridged Adapter as "Attached to:" so the machine can get its own IP.

  If you are using windows and are using Putty for connecting through ssh, you will need to convert the private key generated by vagrant by following the steps in the link below:

  https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/wiki/Connect-to-Your-Vagrant-Virtual-Machine-with-PuTTY

  Remember to use the vm's new IP instead of 127.0.0.1<br>
  Login as: vagrant<br>
  Password: vagrant

5. Install WINSCP. https://winscp.net/eng/download.php

6. Get the vm's IP with the command ifconfig.

7. Connect to the vm with WINSCP using STFP as protocol, use the vm's IP, 22 as port and "vagrant" as username and password.

8. ENJOY!
